# TODO

 * fail on non-existent branch/hash
   - suggest best-match by name
 * pluck individual files as well as entire commits, but default to HEAD file version
 * pluck specific hunks via patch
 * confirm that history-view shows correct history
 * confirm that pluck includes non-local remote history
 * add `-i` interactive flag to trigger interactive selection, otherwise default to passed arguments
